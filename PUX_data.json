In comparison, making changes to a piece of text is quite easy – just cut and paste the words where you want them. The reason it is so much easier for text is that unlike a flowchart, there are no visible connections following the words around. But as a result, it’s also much harder to see the relationship between the ideas in a text at a glance (SE1). The only way to understand a paragraph is to read it.

These visual cues are often called ‘affordances’ drawing on the kind of physical analogy that imitates real world buttons or levers, where the shape suggests places to push or pull. Diagrams can incorporate such elements if appropriate (ME1, ME2, ME6), and if there is a genuine physical correspondence in the diagram meaning, this can be very helpful (TE4, PE2).

Ideally, system response and feedback should be immediate (less than a video frame of 20ms, or at worst under 100ms). In practice, many processes take longer than this to complete. One approach is to give the user fast visual feedback while waiting for the action to take effect.

These might provide a succinct (VE4) alternative to a laborious combination of elements (PE5), or create elements that correspond directly to concepts in your own work (ME2, PE2). However, these powers come at a price. The ‘meta-level’ thinking necessary to make good abstractions is familiar to mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers, but is not an everyday skill for most people (TE1). Doing it badly can even make the diagram harder to use (SE1, ME2, TE4). For this reason, most systems don’t ask users to start every task by thinking about what abstractions they need (PE1), but provide some kind of meta-tool or meta-diagram that can be used to specify new elements once they are clearly necessary. These meta-diagrams can provide creative insights when you are immersed in them (TE5), but they have their own sets of patterns and experience profiles – for example, complex structures of abstraction can make it hard to modify the meta-diagram later (SE2)."

    "long_description":"Everybody who reads a diagram sees it in their own way. But sometimes the diagram author wants to suggest a particular reading (SA1), or even change the way the diagram would otherwise be interpreted (SA3). It is possible to suggest other interpretations to human readers by adding informal notes or guidance (ME5), but if the ‘readers’ of the diagram include computer programs, it is necessary to specify how the new interpretation should be processed. This could be as simple as modifying the visual appearance of elements or wording of labels (ME1, ME2, ME6), but it could take the form of defining one element in terms of another. As soon as such facilities become generically powerful, they start to gain the advantages – and also disadvantages – of abstract languages (CE1)."

    "long_description":"In situations where a diagram is being created to explore ideas, or discover something new, the visual attributes can often support this by allowing parts and relationships to be blurry or ambiguous. Many creative designers intentionally work with soft pencils, broad brushes or rapid actions to encourage the serendipity of seeing something new or different in what they have drawn. Not only are sketches informal and provisional (PE4) – they are also resources for thinking (TE2, TE3). Of course, the informality of sketches makes them quite inappropriate for many other more rigorous kinds of diagram application (VE2, SE1, SE3, ME2, ME3, ME4, TE4)."

    "long_description":"Users can always invent new ways of working with the tools you give them. In order to support the widest possible range of use, it may be helpful to allow all possible ways of reading and creating diagrams, not just adding comments (ME5). Once people become familiar with tools, they often prefer shortcuts, or leave out recommended steps. When they are not so expert, they may do things the ‘wrong’ way. Their approach might not be optimal, but if it works, preventing it would only annoy them. Flexibility like this can support patterns TE5, PE1 and PE4. Of course, flexibility does have disadvantages. If parts have multiple meanings, their purpose might not be so clear (ME2), and it might be harder to work out what to do with them (TE4). If you don’t know what people are going to do, it is harder to give a clear story (VE2), or guide them to the most appropriate actions (IE5, PE2)."
