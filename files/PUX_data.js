The reason it is so much easier for text is that unlike a flowchart, there are no visible connections following the words around. But as a result, it\u2019s also much harder to see the relationship between the ideas in a text at a glance (SE1). The only way to understand a paragraph is to read it.

Ideally, system response and feedback should be immediate (less than a video frame of 20ms, or at worst under 100ms). In practice, many processes take longer than this to complete.

This is why popular references to algebra refer to \u2018x\u2019 as the \u2018unknown quantity\u2019. Using such abstract symbols can mean that people are less able to do everyday reasoning (demonstrated in psychological experiments like the \u2018Wason task\u2019 (Wason 1968)). As a result, if diagram elements refer directly to the user\u2019s problem (ME1, PE2) this can make the diagram easier to use for simple tasks. On the other hand, increasing the specificity of meaning in this way reduces the expressive power (CE1, CE2, CE3). This is a rather constant trade-off in the design of highly generic technical diagrams such as visual programming languages."

If the system doesn’t recognise that you are always doing the same thing, this can become repetitious and tedious. Repetition is also one of the reasons for viscosity (SE2) when a single change needs to be applied in many different places. In these circumstances, it’s useful to be able to program a system to do the repetition for you, or even define a new language element that specifies where the same combination should be applied (CE1). The danger of doing this is that the original relationships become invisible, hidden by the new language element (SE1), and also that the more powerful new feature may result in larger accidents (IE4)."

Many diagrams, and aspects of diagrams, are more or less transient. Even where they are permanently recorded, information in previous versions may be lost. It’s not always useful to keep everything – previous versions themselves become part of the information structure, and you need ways to find them (VE3, SE3). It’s not always easy to see what has changed (SE4), because the visual appearance hasn’t emphasised the significant changes (ME4). Asking users to add information explaining the history (ME5) adds extra managerial overhead for every revision (SE2).

However, these powers come at a price. The \u2018meta-level\u2019 thinking necessary to make good abstractions is familiar to mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers, but is not an everyday skill for most people (TE1). Doing it badly can even make the diagram harder to use (SE1, ME2, TE4). For this reason, most systems don\u2019t ask users to start every task by thinking about what abstractions they need (PE1), but provide some kind of meta-tool or meta-diagram that can be used to specify new elements once they are clearly necessary. These meta-diagrams can provide creative insights when you are immersed in them (TE5), but they have their own sets of patterns and experience profiles \u2013 for example, complex structures of abstraction can make it hard to modify the meta-diagram later (SE2)."

Not only are sketches informal and provisional (PE4) \u2013 they are also resources for thinking (TE2, TE3).
